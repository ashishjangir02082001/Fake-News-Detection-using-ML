This project has been implemented by four different algorithms, namely:

### - [Logistic Regression](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logistic_regression.html)
### - [Decision Tree Algorithms](https://www.xoriant.com/blog/product-engineering/decision-trees-machine-learning-algorithm.html)
### - [Gradient Boosting Classifier](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/04/how-the-gradient-boosting-algorithm-works/)
### - [Random Forest Classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2)

#### The accuracies that different algorithms yield are as follows:

- Logistic Regression -> 98.84%
- Decision Tree Algorithms -> 99.57%
- Gradient Boosting Classifier -> 99.53%
- Random Forest Classifier -> 99.19%
