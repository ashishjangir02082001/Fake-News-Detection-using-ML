# Fake-News-Detection-using-ML

### **Overview:**

This is an ML based prediction project implemented in Python language that classifies a news as a Real or a Fake News. The project has 
been implemented by the help of different algorithms mentioned below. As with the growth of internet, a lot of fake news are spread and 
people are always confused about whether the news they are sharing or seeing is actually real or fake. This dilemma sometimes creates a 
lot of problems politically and socially which leads to loss of lives many a times due to mis-information. So in order to curb the spread 
of such fake news, this project has been created, so that people may check any news whether it is credible or not at the same time and save
themselves and others as well from getting caught into the hands of the criminal minds.

### The libraries and editor used to develop this project are:

#### This project has been implemented by four different algorithms, namely:
- ### [Logistic Regression](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logistic_regression.html)
- ### [Decision Tree Algorithms](https://www.xoriant.com/blog/product-engineering/decision-trees-machine-learning-algorithm.html)
- ### [Gradient Boosting Classifier](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/04/how-the-gradient-boosting-algorithm-works/)
- ### [Random Forest Classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2)

#### The accuracies that different algorithms yield are as follows:

- Logistic Regression -> 98.84%
- Decision Tree Algorithms -> 99.57%
- Gradient Boosting Classifier -> 99.53%
- Random Forest Classifier -> 99.19%
